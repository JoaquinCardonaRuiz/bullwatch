# Bullwatch

A simple script that searches for recent tweets containing the names and symbols of the most popular cryptocurrencies and scans them for keywords to evaluate the overall sentiment towards the future value of one cryptocurrency. The result is presented as the ratio of bullish tweets to bearish tweets. The list of cryptocurrencies considered can be found (and altered) in cryptos.csv
